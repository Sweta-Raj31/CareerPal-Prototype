# problem statement
Making Career Choices and AI based Counselling accessible to every child at secondary level along with aptitude tests and detailed career paths.
# Does the problem statement actually matter?
A recent survey on career option awareness among Indian students has revealed that a staggering 93% of the students aged 14 to 21 were aware of just seven career options though there are more than 250 different types of job options available in India.
# Abstract
This presentation presents the design of an expert system for educational guidance and career counseling for students from grades 9 to 12. Artificial intelligence involves two basic ideas. First, it involves studying the thought processes of human beings. Second, it deals with representing those processes via machines. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies help us for various purposes, including decision-making. This project involves an AI-based expert system that allows the students to give a basic idea of possible career opportunities. This project will help the students by considering the student's interests and aptitude for test results. Apart from this, the students can get detailed information about how to pursue the recommended career path.
# What is our solution and how does it stand out?
We, ourselves, have been children in the past and understand how difficult it can be to choose a future career. In those days, we used to be completely overwhelmed by the vastness of it. Sometimes, competition kills the zeal, and other times, ignorance steals the opportunity. To solve this problem, we have come up with a guided approach to online counseling,by Website:- Anyone who is looking forward to taking online counseling can visit the website and take a demo aptitude test.
by ML based recommandation:-Assessing students' interests through aptitude tests and recommending the best career path based on their answers.by chatbot:-No student should ever lose any opportunity for doubt or unawareness. For this, we are providing an Ai-based chatbot.and caeer roadmap resources:- Recommendations aren't the end of our work. We will help you pursue your career in the right way so that you will achieve your goals.

# Approach to the solution of the problem statement divided on 4 parts
1. Decided the parameters for developing the recommendation system and framed questions and simultaneously, started training the chatbot.
2. Collected data from the students from grades 9 to 12 using google form and generated the datasets..
3. Will integrate the recommendation system and chatbot on the website.
4. Now, the proposed solution to the problem statement should stand ready!

# How do the aptitude tests work?
You have to sign up and take the test. Answer the questions within given time limit .Your answers are evaluated and then according to your score career choices are recommended.Along with recommendations, get the roadmap like exams you need to give, which colleges you should apply or which soft skill is required for your sector.
 # What model are we applying?
 
We are creating an ML model, which is a neural network model and is implemented by using TensorFlow and Keras API for predicting the suitable career options based on the behavioral characteristics and the score of the students.


# Are the datasets efffective?
Yes, they are! Training the dataset for the neural network model was procured in the form of normalized scores based on the student's responses.
# Neural network algorithm
 Start thinking neural network as an artificial brain. Artificial neural networks (ANN) or simply, neural networks are based on the collection of connected nodes which are called artificial neurons and are inspired by the neurons in a human brain. This ANN model has 3 types of layers:
 Input Layer
Hidden Layer
Output Layer

# BASIC MECHANISM OF NEURAL NETWORKS
# Working Methodology
It takes inputs and processes them in the hidden layers using predefined activation functions and then delivers the output.
# Accuracy and efficiency
We are using classification technique for unclassified data. Modal may have more than 85% accuracy, to improve the accuracy , we might increase hidden layers, or scale our data,we can also change learning algorithm paramenters.

# Our AI-Based Chatbot 24/7 access to e-counsellor
We will be at the forefront of technology, 
speed and aim of career counseling bot are to carry out a conversation between both human and machine. Some knowledge has been embedded into the machine so that it identifies the sentences and making a decision itself as response to answer a question. modernism

# USE CASES:-
Our Model ANN which is a concept of deep learning, is used for various purposes.
Here we are using it for classification of data given by the student.We are recommending the career field to students based on their interest and score they got in aptitude test.For now we are collecting the data from students through google form but later on students will be able to register themselves on website and can take aptitude test.Based on test marks recommendation of career along with their different exams and top colleges where he/she can take admission through such entrance.

# Business Goals
Come up with premium membership plans with one-to-one career counselling
Provide newsletters, one-to-one career advice personalized academical recommendations, and guidance on soft-skill enhancements.
Escalate the project to impart personalized online mentorships in different fields and help in placements
Provide academic assistance and tutoring opportunities. Students can take the courses from their homes and mentors can earn their own money depending on their abilities.
